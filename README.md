R codes of the paper:

Yeqing Zhou, Kai Xu, Liping Zhu & Runze Li (2024). Rank-based Indices for Testing Independence between Two High-Dimensional Vectors. The Annals of Statistics, 52(1), 184-206.

We provide the R codes to conduct the tests based on Hoeffding’s $D$, Blum-Kiefer-Rosenblatt’s $R$ and Bergsma–Dassios–Yanagimoto’s $\tau^*$.
